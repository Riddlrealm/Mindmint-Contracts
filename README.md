# Mindmint - Smart Contracts

Soroban smart contracts powering Mindmint, a logic puzzle game on the Stellar blockchain.

## 🔐 Contracts Overview

### Achievement NFT Contract
Mints and manages NFT achievements for puzzle completion milestones.

### Reward Token Contract
Manages custom token rewards and puzzle unlocks.

- Fraud detection with cooldowns and frequency limits
- Premium pool management
- Prorated refunds on cancellation

# Prediction Market Contract - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Design Prediction Market Structure ✓
- Defined `Market` struct with all necessary fields
- Created `MarketStatus` enum (Open, Closed, Resolved, Disputed)
- Designed `Bet` and `OutcomePool` structures
- Implemented `Dispute` mechanism

### 2. Implement Market Creation with Outcomes ✓
- `create_market()` function with validation
- Minimum 2 outcomes required
- Future resolution time validation
- Automatic outcome pool initialization
- Event emission for market creation

### 3. Add Bet Placement and Pooling ✓
- `place_bet()` function with token transfer
- Bet tracking per user and market
- Outcome pool aggregation
- Multiple bets per user supported
- Timestamp recording for each bet

### 4. Create Outcome Resolution Mechanism ✓
- `resolve_market()` admin function
- Winning outcome selection
- Status transition validation
- Resolution event emission

### 5. Implement Winner Payout Distribution ✓
- `claim_winnings()` function
- Proportional payout calculation: `(user_bet * total_pool) / winning_pool`
- Prevents double claiming
- Automatic token transfer to winners

### 6. Add Market Maker Functionality ✓
- `add_liquidity()` function
- Liquidity provider tracking
- Liquidity pool management
- Incentive structure for market makers

### 7. Create Liquidity Incentives ✓
- Liquidity amount tracking per market
- Provider address storage
- Integration with payout mechanism

### 8. Write Prediction Market Tests ✓
- ✅ test_create_market
- ✅ test_place_bet_and_claim_winnings
- ✅ test_liquidity_provision
- ✅ test_partial_cashout
- ✅ test_dispute_resolution
- ✅ test_multiple_bets_same_user
- ✅ test_create_market_insufficient_outcomes
- ✅ test_claim_before_resolution
- **All 8 tests passing**

### 9. Add Dispute Resolution ✓
- `raise_dispute()` function for users
- `resolve_dispute()` admin function
- Dispute status tracking
- Optional outcome change on resolution
- Dispute event emissions

### 10. Implement Partial Cashout ✓
- `partial_cashout()` function
- 10% fee mechanism (90% return)
- Early exit from open markets
- Bet claiming prevention after cashout
